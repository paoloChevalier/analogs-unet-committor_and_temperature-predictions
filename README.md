# analogs-unet-committor_and_temperature-predictions

Work on committor function estimation using analogs and temperature predictions using UNET networks in ERA5 to evaluate the transfer learning from IPSL-CM6A-LR. This work was done during my internship at LSCE (Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement) and the CEA (Commissariat à l'énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives)

## Installation

To use locally, make sure you have the pangeo distribution installed for general scripts/notebooks and a distribution including tensorflow >2.15 for the scripts on UNETs.
All scripts and notebooks should work seamlessly on the IPSL mésocentre computing center (spirit(x) and hal).

## Usage

## Data

The data needed is from IPSL-CM6A-LR and ERA5. Both available online [here](https://esgf-node.ipsl.upmc.fr/search/cmip6-ipsl/) and [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/).

## Contributing

As this work was done during an internship, I probably won't have the time to update this repo nor deal with contributions if not small. If needed I am always reachable by email preferably.
